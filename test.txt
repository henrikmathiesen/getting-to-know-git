A change in a new branch
- if we just push after branching, we get this message: 
'fatal: The current branch a_new_branch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
git push --set-upstream origin a_new_branch'
- we could do 'git push origin a_new_branch', that will push one time to remote with this branch
- we could also do 'git push -u origin a_new_branch', to push to remote with this branch and set it to default tracking upstream branch
- if we just push now, then we push to the default tracking upstream branch a_new_branch

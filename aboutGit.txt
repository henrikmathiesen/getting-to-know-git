# LAYERS

- Distributed Revision Control System
- Revision Control System
- A Stupid Content Tracker
- A Persistant Map, key to values, stored on disc - The Core


# The Core Layer - A Persistant Map

- values are a squence of bytes, for example a text file
- keys are hashes, SHA1
$ echo "Apple Pie" | git hash-object --stdin // will give a hash key for the text
- Every file, directory and comment has a hash key and the key is unique

Persisting a change
$ echo "Apple Pie" | git hash-object --stdin -w // need a repository, content is saved (it does however not register as a change when git status)
- it is saved to .git/objects/xx where xx is first 2 digits of hash, there is a file in there (GIT calls it a BLOB of data) with a name that is the rest of the characters in the hash
$ git cat-file 23991897e13e47ed0adb91a0082c31c82fe0cbe5 -t // -t = type , blob
$ git cat-file 23991897e13e47ed0adb91a0082c31c82fe0cbe5 -p // -p = pretty, Apple Pie


# The Content Tracker Layer

$ git status // show untracked files as red, GIT does not know what to do with them
- to commit a file it must be put in the so called staging area
